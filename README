USAGE

[video_capture.py]
Step 0: Capture the video feed and store to file

        python video_capture.py

        The parameters can be adjusted in the main() function within the python script.
        By default, it runs continuously and generates files with 1 second worth of video 
        ffed. It creates the output directory if it does not already exist.

[define_regions.py]
Step 1: Define the regions of interest

        python define_regions.py -c <camera_id> -f <video_file.mp4>
        
        Define the "region of interest" using mouse clicks
        The newly defined region is stored in a file called "regions/region-<camera_id>"
        This region can be used in the subsequent step

[track_regions.py]
Step 2: Run the object detection

        python track_regions -c <camera_id> -f <video_file.mp4> -m <model_file>
        Model file is called yolov8s-pt-20.pt, and can be downloaded from one drive below:
        https://ramennetworks1-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/sandesh_goel_rameninc_com/EnihWw5SKVpEubo8zDobDoUB7wcOnD2bva4vYqDYbJnmTQ?e=05MR3O

        Running count of orange bags detected within each region of interest is shown on the screen

        Output video is saved to a file with the same name as the input file with a suffix of "-out"

OPTIONS
-------
-b : Execute in batch mode (no display, faster) when this switch is specified
-n <numframes> : Execute for specified number of frames and then quit
-s <numframes> : Skip specified number of frames in the beginning of the video
-w <wait> : Wait for specified duration in miliseconds between displaying frames 
            to slow down the output video (valid ONLY in non-batch mode)
-v : Enable verbose logging (generates output for each frame)

-c : specify the camera id
-f : specify the video file to process 
-m : specify the model file to be used
-r : specify the region file to be used (only if camera id not provided)

-l : specify the name of directory which contains live streaming files
     in this mode, the latest files are automatically picked up for processing
     the file name should start with time of recording in yyyy-mm-dd_hh-mm-ss format

STATIONARY OBJECT DETECTION
---------------------------
Detect if an object is stationary based on following thresholds

-d : number of pixels by which it must move between successive frames (default 2 pixels) 
     to be deemed non-stationary
-t : number of successive frames for which it should be stationary to be flagged 
     (default 5 frames)
